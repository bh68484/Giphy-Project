# Giphy-Project

### Overview

For this assignment I implemented use of the Giphy API to request gifs based on the users input. A list of initial queries was dynamically created with JavaScript and jQuery and attached on the page. The user could click an initial button to retrieve 10 still gifs that, when clicked on, would animate the gifs. When any image was clicked again it would change back to being still.  
The user also has the option of using the input button to query for other gifs. In the case of my project the theme was Tv Shows.

Upon submitting a request of a new show, a new button would be dynamically created and attached to the page. Like the initial gif buttons, when the user clicked on the new button they created, the ajax call would use the parameters I set up and query the new Tv show they had chosen. The gifs again were displayed on the page like the initial ones, and the user would be able to click to animate them and stop them.

Once the logic to create the buttons, search, and use Giphyâ€™s API, I then styled the page with CSS.
